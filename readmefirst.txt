I'd like to work on more coding projects like these that can help people do things
and be more productive, currently I'm working on a traffic simulation thing for 
my thesis that can hopefully prove that the traffic design I'm studying is more 
efficient

================================================================================

This is a simple tool for creating answer sheets and checking large CET dry-runs
Just give it what it asks for and it'll do the rest for you

It's about 450~ lines of code
I must say that the time it took to automate the thing was probably longer than
the actual thing needed to be done
But for you, it'll at least lessen about an hour of your review time.

Teachers can also use this as well if they can apply it to their need

================================================================================

Info:
-Try it on the ACET reviewer
-Keep main.exe in a folder, it creates files around it
-The input box for the answer key is highly sensitive, start from the top part and
 just paste
-Use X for both the answer key and answer sheet for bonuses
-You can use lowercase to answer if you like
-When you create a new answer sheet it deletes everything previously in the file,
 just create a copy of it if you want to save it
-No it's not a virus, it doesn't have permission on anything secure. Your 
 anti-virus is freaking out because it's from an unknown source. I don't even 
 know how networks work

=================================================================================

Future Updates:
-PDF tool, automatically extracts answer key from pdf
-Better GUI
-Random Question Polling from your contributions (I really want to do this)
i was going to finish these fully, but it's july and upcat is 3 months away,kinda
need to review

=================================================================================

Issues:
-Ugly GUI (i got tired)
-Some errors are not caught, so follow the input needed explicitly

=================================================================================

shameless plug:
if you have questions about this thing, questions in general, and suggestions for
future stuff:
